# USA-Seattle-Airbnb-Tableau-Project
Project Workflow:
Data Preparation and Cleaning: The dataset is preprocessed, cleaning any anomalies or missing data, and ensuring accurate data points are available for analysis.

Data Analysis and Dashboard Creation in Tableau: The visualizations are built in Tableau, creating an interactive dashboard that users can navigate to explore specific metrics by zip code, bedroom count, and revenue estimates.

This project provides valuable insights for Airbnb hosts, property investors, and travelers, helping them make informed decisions on property investments, rentals, and vacation planning within Seattle.
